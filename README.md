## Background
_What is this?_ This is a series of small games that I've coded on my free time
as an attempt to improve my coding skills. These range from clicking games that
draw shapes to slightly more complicated games such as minesweeper. All of
these games are made using PyQt5 interface. You can see a more in-depth
description of each game/project in each of their respective sub-folders. 
Please feel free to try out some of the games yourself if you're interested!

_Why are they all in the same project?_ All of these games don't require too 
much code (ranging from 100~500 lines including comments), and so having a 
separate project folder for each game seemed excessive. 

_Who am I?_ I'm a Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering undergraduate
senior currently studying at Johns Hopkins University. I haven't had much (if
any) coding experience prior to sophomore year of college, and because of the
relatively late start, I thought that this would provide me with a lot of
coding experience that could be useful in the future.

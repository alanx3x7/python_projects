## Background
**_What is this?_** This is a series of small games that I've coded on my free 
time as an attempt to improve my coding skills. I haven't had much (if any) 
coding experience prior to  sophomore year of college, and because of the 
relatively late start, I thought  that this would provide me with a lot of
coding experience that could be useful in the future. These programs range from
clicking games that draw shapes to slightly more complicated games such as 
minesweeper. All of these games are made using PyQt5 interface. You can see a 
more in-depth description of each game/project in each of their respective 
sub-folders. Please feel free to try out some of the games yourself if you're 
interested!

**_Why are they all in the same project?_** All of these games don't require 
too much code (ranging from 100~1000 lines including comments), and so having 
a separate project folder for each game seemed excessive. This is also much 
easier to manage as well. 

**_Who am I?_** I'm a Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering undergraduate
senior currently studying at Johns Hopkins University. I'm interested in a 
future career in the medical robotics industry, and you can learn more about me
from me [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-lai-756969129). I'm still 
learning as much as I can, and if you have any ideas as to what projects I 
could do, please let me know via email! Thanks!
